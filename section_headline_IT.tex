\par{With a strong analytical background from engineering, and having diverse career experience working in both public and private organisations in consulting, design and project management roles, I have a unique range of skills that I'll use to bring value to any company.  From my first role working with data in France in agile project management involving database development, software design and analysis, I understood the potential data could offer.  I have since completed a Graduate Diploma in Data Science and began working with systems, building risk categorisation and predictive models, and analysing and reporting on a wide range of data. My goal is to continue to develop the skills that will enable me to design the best solutions to difficult problems and discover meaningful insights that bring added value to an organisation. \\
