\par{Dear Mark,\\

I am writing to express my interest in the Principal Engineer (Civil) – Investment Planning position with Transport and Main Roads (TMR). As a current TMR employee with RPEQ registration and previous experience acting in a Principal Engineer role, I bring a well-rounded perspective grounded in road infrastructure project delivery and management. This role’s emphasis on long-term transport planning to help shape our region aligns with my professional interests and the areas I’ve been increasingly involved in through my recent work.\\

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Planning Familiarity:} I have an understanding of the objectives, processes, and intent behind the ATAP, OnQ, and PAF frameworks. Within the region, I’ve had exposure to both the strategic planning and project planning teams while acting as Principal Engineer, and I’ve reviewed and contributed to these processes primarily in a stakeholder capacity for structures.\\
  \item \textbf{Transport Experience:} My work at RECOR involved aligning urban development outcomes with broader network demands and planning principles. I collaborated with transport modellers and local governments to assess network impacts and ensure infrastructure investments supported long-term growth, safety, and functionality—paralleling the objectives of investment planning under ATAP.\\
  \item \textbf{Decision-Making and Governance:}At TMR, I oversee structure management and asset rehabilitation planning, ensuring decisions support both immediate safety and long-term asset performance objectives. In previous roles, I led the development and implementation of complex strategic and operational frameworks across varied environments, carefully balancing contractual, regulatory, and legislative requirements—both local and international—to support sound organisational funding and decision-making.\\
  \item \textbf{Project Delivery and Systems Understanding:} I have led projects through all stages of the transport infrastructure lifecycle throughout my career. I understand the importance of planning and delivery integration, stakeholder engagement, risk and opportunity analysis, and quality assurance processes in delivering successful outcomes. At RECOR, I developed and implemented the organisation’s integrated QHSE management system, achieving ISO 9001, 27001, and 45001 certification for the delivery of civil and structural projects—demonstrating strong governance and delivery capability. \\
  \item \textbf{Communication and Leadership:} I bring experience producing clear, detailed, and strategic reports, and have chaired stakeholder meetings, technical reviews, and interagency consultations as project manager across various domains. My leadership of engineering teams at RECOR and my collaborative work at TMR have reinforced my ability to foster teamwork and ensure project and planning alignment.\\
\end{itemize}

I am motivated by the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to Queensland’s transport future, and I recognise that sound investment decisions are fundamental to this. This role aligns with my professional strengths and personal aspirations around sustainable infrastructure development.\\

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the goals of the Investment Planning team and would welcome the chance to contribute further.

\\
Yours sincerely,

%    I am writing to express my interest in the Principal Engineer (Civil) position with Transport and Main Roads (TMR) in the Investment Planning team. As a current TMR employee with RPEQ registration and experience in an acting Principal Engineer role, I am confident in my ability to contribute significantly to the team's objectives. \\
%
%	Throughout my career, I have developed a comprehensive skill set that aligns closely with the key responsibilities and requirements of this role: \\
%
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Transport Planning: As demonstrated in my role at RECOR, I've developed a high-level understanding of traffic and transport planning principles and their application to urban development, networks and road safety. I regularly collaborated with transport modellers and engineers to analyze how urban developments would impact both local roads and the broader transport network based on development scale, location sensitivity, and network demands, and have previously prepared local network and intersection models in SIDRA. I have a strong understanding of road safety outcomes and have provided expert support to Gympie Regional council around road safety and speed limit reviews and how changes can influence road and pedestrian behaviours. \\
%		\item Makes Insightful Decisions: My experience encompasses managing competing needs and priorities while maintaining alignment with broader strategic objectives. At TMR, I've implemented structure management plans for assets requiring rehabilitation, making decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term asset performance. During my time at Vinci, I managed international projects requiring complex decision-making across different regulatory environments and stakeholder needs. This experience has developed my judgment about when to escalate issues and when to resolve them independently, skills that will be vital for managing planning aspects of road infrastructure programs. \\
%		\item Produces High-Quality Deliverables:I have consistently delivered high-quality reports and documentation throughout my career. In all my roles I've taken pride in my ability to produce high-quality reports, strategies and technical documentation, that were clear, concise, and tailored to specific customer and organisational requirements. This attention to detail and quality control will ensure that planning projects and reports will be delivered to meet TMR's quality standards. \\
%		\item Drives Accountability and Outcomes: My project management experience across various sectors demonstrates my persistence in working through obstacles. At TMR, I've delivered remediation projects within scope and budget by maintaining accountability and collaboration throughout the project lifecycle. At RECOR, I successfully established and led the civil engineering discipline, leading a small team of engineers and designers while overcoming the challenges of small business through accountability and successfully delivering outcomes. This approach will be valuable when managing operational aspects of Transport Planning related projects and ensuring effective use of systems and processes.\\
%		\item Demonstrates Sound Governance: Through my roles at TMR, Noosa Council, and other organizations, I've developed a strong understanding of legislative and regulatory frameworks. In my current role, I ensure compliance with TMR standards, legislation, and regulations when supervising engineering works. At RECOR, I implemented ISO 9001, 45001, and 14001 management systems, demonstrating my commitment to governance requirements. This experience will ensure I maintain and apply all relevant standards, policies, and legislative requirements necessary for the planning, design, and construction of road infrastructure projects. \\
%		\item RPEQ Certification: I hold a Washington Accord accredited degree in Engineering and RPEQ registration as required for this role. \\
%
%	My current role at TMR has given me valuable insight into the organization's objectives and processes, while my previous experience acting as Principal Engineer for a short term has helped prepared me for the responsibilities of this position. I would enjoy the opportunity to fulfil this role because it allows me to apply my expertise in diverse areas of civil engineering and project management while contributing to shaping the infrastructure in and around the community in which I live. The role's emphasis on delivering high-quality outcomes for Queenslanders resonates strongly with my professional values and aspirations.\\

%	I would be more than happy to chat further to discuss my application and am available at your convenience to provide any further information you require by phone or email on the contact details listed above.\\
%	Looking forward to your hearing from you.\\
