\par{Having diverse career experience, from design and consulting in civil and structural engineering, international project management for large scale infrastructure management projects, to working with systems and data analysis, I have a unique range of that I'll use to bring value to any organisation. \\

Although most recently working in an information analyst role, my goal is to return to a position at an engineering consultancy, where i have the opportunity to design creative solutions to difficult problems using the skills Iâ€™ve developed over my career, with the goal of completing my professional registration and becoming chartered. \\
