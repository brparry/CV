\par{With a strong background in asset management for highways and local councils, and having diverse career experience working in both public and private organisations, from design and consulting in civil and structural engineering, international project management for large scale infrastructure management projects, to data systems and analysis, I have a unique range of skills that I'll use to bring value to any company. Although most recently working in an information analyst role, my goal is to return to a position in an engineering role, where i have the opportunity to design creative solutions to difficult problems using the skills Iâ€™ve developed over my career with the goal of completing my professional registration and becoming chartered. \\
