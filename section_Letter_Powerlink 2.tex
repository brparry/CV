\par{Dear Ms Bossennec,\\
	
	I'm applying for the Asset Management Engineer position at Powerlink. I bring 15 years of infrastructure asset management experience across bridge networks, major culverts, pavements and stormwater systems—delivering risk-based lifecycle planning, condition assessment programs and data-driven reinvestment strategies in both government and commercial environments.\\
	
	At Transport and Main Roads, I have managed a \$2.5B portfolio of more than 1,000 bridges and major culverts, leading condition assessments, structural remediation planning and heavy vehicle access approvals while balancing asset integrity, safety and lifecycle cost. I’ve developed deterioration models, coordinated technical specialists and managed consultant and contractor procurement to deliver asset programs within budget. This work integrates structural condition data, risk analysis and strategic priorities to inform capital investment decisions - the same capability Powerlink needs to optimise transmission asset performance and reliability.\\

	Before TMR, I delivered asset management solutions internationally with Freyssinet (VINCI Group), developing inspection and maintenance frameworks for bridges, tunnels and highways across multiple jurisdictions. At Noosa Council and Pavement Management Services, I led linear network asset management for pavement and stormwater programs, building risk-based renewal models and multi-year capital works plans.\\
	
	My analytical capability strengthens this asset management foundation. With a Graduate Diploma in Data Science and experience as an Information Analyst, I bring advanced skills in statistical modeling, predictive analytics and data visualization using R, Python and SQL. I've consistently applied these capabilities to asset management challenges by developing deterioration models, building risk-based prioritization frameworks, and creating performance dashboards that transform complex condition data into clear investment recommendations. This combination of engineering judgment and analytical rigor positions me to maximize value from Powerlink's asset data and support evidence-based decision making.\\
	
	I understand transmission assets differ from civil structures - transformers and switchgear aren’t bridges, but asset management principles are universal: understanding failure modes, balancing reliability against cost, using condition data to optimise intervention timing, and coordinating specialists to achieve network performance. My civil engineering background and extensive structural asset management experience provide strong analytical foundations, and I’m confident I can rapidly build transmission-specific technical knowledge within Powerlink’s collaborative environment.\\
	
	I’m motivated by infrastructure that enables communities, and I’m drawn to Powerlink’s mission at a pivotal time for Queensland’s energy transition. I’d welcome the opportunity to contribute my asset management expertise and data-driven approach to support network reliability and long-term resilience. I look forward to discussing this further with you.\\
	
	Yours sincerely,\\
