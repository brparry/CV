I would like to resubmit my prior application to express my interest in the Asset Management Engineering position posted by NOVA Partners on Seek, having previously attached the incorrect resume for the postiion.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil)/Bachelor of Arts with first class honours from the University of Queensland in 2009. I began working in various civil and structural design consultancies in Brisbane and Northern NSW, which allowed me to gain a familiarity working within the design environment and engaging with clients, stakeholders and councils to deliver projects through the deign and construction stages of projects. In 2012 I took up a role as an international project manager within the French construction company, Vinci, managing the delivery of asset management plans and solutions to highway concessionaires  and asset managers. Upon returning to Australia in 2016, I began working with Noosa Council as a technical officer in their asset management team working heavily with pavement reseal planning and stormwater drainage inspection campaigns, before joining the University of the Sunshine Coast in an information analyst role.   

My previous experience has given me a wide range of exposure and experience in project management, business administration and different technical skills, however I am keen to return my focus to asset management. I would ideally like to obtaining my chartered status and contributing to interesting projects that contribute positively to local communities, and from the description of the position I feel like this would be well suited to me so would love the opportunity to apply. I believe I could be valuable to your company bringing the following experience and skills:

\cvlist{
	\item A wide range of asset management engineering experience, as well as in depth knowledge of asset management systems and best practices, 
	
	\item Preparing inspection and maintenance plans, as well as civil and structural engineering designs, 
	
	\item Experience producing technical and commercial engineering project documentation,
	
	\item Experience with CAD and various engineering design software (AutoCAD, CivilCAD, Space GASS, STRAND 7 etc) and generally highly fluent with data and analytics (R, Python, SQL),
	
	\item Strong project management and organisational skills, with excellent time management, ability to plan, organise and deliver work on budget, excellent written and oral communication skills,
}


I would be more than happy to chat further to discuss my application, and am available at your convenience to provide any further information you require by phone or email on the contact details listed above.
