I am writing to express my interest in the Civil Engineer position with Cardno on the Sunshine Coast.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) with first class honours obtained from the University of Queensland in 2009. I have worked in various roles primarily in civil engineering, asset management and project management in both domestic and international environments.   

My previous experience has given me a wide range of skills in engineering design, contracts administration, technical report preparation, project management, business administration, commercial negotiations and a high level of general technical skills which i believe would be valuable to any organisation. I am a highly adaptable, conscientious worker and am able to rapidly develop new skills to help negotiate any new challenges I encounter. I have always found civil engineering consulting to provide me a high level of job satisfaction as i enjoy working with the community and contributing to interesting projects that enrich the environment in which we live so I would love to continue working in an environment that would provide these aspects in the role. 

I feel like this position would be well suited to my interests and background so I would love the opportunity to apply. I believe I'd be valuable in this position bringing the following skills and experience:


\cvlist{
	\item Experience in a civil engineering consultancy carrying out preliminary and detailed design and modelling for urban developments, including stormwater, roads, traffic and subdivisions,
	
	\item Strong project management and contractual knowledge with excellent time management, interpersonal skills, an ability to plan, organise and deliver work on budget, and excellent written and oral communication,
	
	\item Highly skilled at producing technical and commercial engineering project documentation with a high level of attention to detail,
	
	\item Experience with CAD and various engineering design software (CivilCAD, AutoCAD, MUSIC, XP-RAFTS, Space GASS, QGIS, etc) and generally highly fluent with software and data,
	
	\item A member of Engineers Australia in the Civil and Structural colleges, currently working towards obtaining my RPEQ
	
}

I would be more than happy to chat about my application, and am available at your convenience to provide any further information you require by phone or email on the contact details listed above. Looking forward to your hearing from you.
