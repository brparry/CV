\par{Dear Mr Brock,\\
	
	I’m applying for the Project Development Lead position at CS Energy. I bring a strong background in planning and delivering major infrastructure projects, coordinating multidisciplinary specialists through structured governance frameworks to produce clear, evidence-based investment and decision-making documentation.\\
	
	As Principal Engineer (Investment Planning) with Transport and Main Roads, I currently lead development of major transport infrastructure proposals. In this role I coordinate inputs from engineering, environmental, cultural heritage and geotechnical disciplines under ATAP, OnQ and PAF frameworks to define problem statements, assess strategic drivers and shape investment-ready submissions. The role requires facilitating workshops on scope, risk, cost and schedule validation and integrating technical, operational and risk perspectives from a range of experts and stakeholders into concise business cases that support executive and ministerial decision-making.\\
	
	My approach is methodical and evidence-based: clearly define the problem, explore options objectively, test assumptions, and communicate recommendations in plain language to effectively convey the risk and cost factors critical to sound decision making. This process has proven transferable across sectors and project types,  whether forecasting and delivering financial forecasts to executives and government,  assessing asset replacement strategies or evaluating corridor upgrades.\\
	
	Before joining TMR, I managed international infrastructure programs in monitoring, strategy and asset management with VINCI Group across Europe, the Middle East and Central America, leading concept development, needs assessments and technical proposals as well as managing the project delivery for government and commercial clients. At RECOR Consulting, I directed multidisciplinary teams from concept through regulatory approvals and delivery, coordinating sub-consultants and embedding ISO-certified governance systems. These roles strengthened my ability to synthesise technical, commercial and stakeholder inputs and to prepare documentation that enables confident investment decisions.\\
	
	I’m a Chartered Professional Engineer (RPEQ, CPEng) with a well developed project management background in PMBOK, PRINCE2 and Agile methods. I’m comfortable facilitating workshops, managing consultant contracts, and translating complex engineering into strategic, financial and risk terms for senior audiences.\\
	
	Power-generation assets do differ from transport  and civil infrastructure, but the discipline of robust project definition and governance is the same. I’m drawn to CS Energy’s pivotal role in Queensland’s energy transition and the opportunity to apply my analytical, collaborative and governance strengths to shape the company’s capital investment pipeline.\\
	
	I’d welcome the chance to discuss how I can support CS Energy’s investment planning and delivery priorities and look forward to hearing from you.\\
	
	Yours sincerely,\\
	
	Benjamin Parry\\
